# Who is Driving

## Objectives

This lab will serve to demonstrate your understanding of the following concepts:

1. Objects and functions
2. Controlling execution
3. Access control
4. Reusing classes
5. Implementing interfaces

## Unit Test

UML is required
Unit test in place before proceeding with code
Make sure you test EVERY public method

## Part 1

In this lab you will find bases classes for *Bike* and *Car*. Both implement the *Drivable* interface, so take time to look and understand this interface. The purpose of the *Drivable* interface is to enforce the functionality of being drivable. Objects that implement this interface will allow transportation for a given distance and at a designated top speed. Pay attention to the comments that accompany some of the method declarations to see what side effects are present when executing that functionality.

The classes you will need to implement logic and complete are the *App*, *toyataSienna*, and MountainBike classes. Make sure to read through all the class and interface files to find the specific implementation details.

## Part 2   

**Add to the fleet**

Now that you have completed the implementation and have all test passing now it is time to add to your program. Create a new car and bike subclass and integrate them into the current application. Test, Test, and Test are required for each additional subclass.

## Part 3

**To the future and beyond**

Finally, lets up the ante and jump into the future. As always, the future hold great wonders and one of my favorites is teleportation. Create a *Teleporter* class the will implement our *Drivable* interface. And now with this teleporting technology we have the ability to send passengers any distance instantly. Once again, test, test, test and implement the required interface methods.
